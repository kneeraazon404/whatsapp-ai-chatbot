# WhatsApp Integration with OpenAI Chatbot

This project demonstrates how to integrate WhatsApp with an OpenAI-powered chatbot using Python and popular tools like FastAPI and Ngrok. This chatbot can be used for various tasks such as customer service, personal assistance, or automated responses through WhatsApp.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure that you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- `pip` (Python package installer)
- [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) (for running ASGI servers)
- [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) (for tunneling and exposing your local server)
  
## Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to get the WhatsApp chatbot running:

### 1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd whatsapp_ai_chatbot
```

### 2. Set up a virtual environment
Create a Python virtual environment to isolate dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the virtual environment

For Linux/macOS:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

For Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 4. Install required dependencies
Use `pip` to install the necessary libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run the FastAPI server
Start the FastAPI server to serve the chatbot:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 6. Expose the local server to the internet using Ngrok
Run Ngrok to expose your FastAPI server to the internet on port `8000`:
```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

### 7. Test the Chatbot on WhatsApp
Once both the FastAPI server and Ngrok are running, you can interact with the OpenAI chatbot through WhatsApp.

## Next Steps

1. Set up your WhatsApp Business API and webhook configuration to send messages to the Ngrok URL generated.
2. Modify the chatbot's logic in `main.py` to customize it for your specific use case.
3. Deploy the solution using cloud services for a production-level setup.
