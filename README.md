## üöÄ Setup Instructions  

Follow these steps to set up and run the WhatsApp chatbot:  

### 1. Clone the Repository  

```bash  
git clone <repository-url>  
cd whatsapp_ai_chatbot  
```  

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment  

Create a Python virtual environment to isolate dependencies:  
```bash  
python -m venv venv  
```  

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment  

For Linux/macOS:  
```bash  
source venv/bin/activate  
```  

For Windows:  
```bash  
venv\Scripts\activate  
```  

### 4. Install Dependencies  

Use `pip` to install the required libraries:  
```bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```  

### 5. Run the FastAPI Server  

Start the FastAPI server to serve the chatbot:  
```bash  
uvicorn main:app --reload  
```  

### 6. Expose the Local Server Using Ngrok  

Expose your FastAPI server to the internet on port `8000`:  
```bash  
ngrok http 8000  
```  

### 7. Test the Chatbot on WhatsApp  

Once the FastAPI server and Ngrok are running, interact with the OpenAI chatbot through WhatsApp.
